___

Just run like any other python script.

**Tested with python3.9**

## Overview

Probably the easiest snake game to make. Pygame gives us all the tools we need.

If you want music to play while playing this game, put the song in the same directory as this script, and rename the song to `midi.mp3` or `midi.wav`

## Development

Pygame is awesome, but I couldn't get it to play music, so it uses the `playsound` module

Nothing else to add, this really was simple

## Remarks

A .json file is created in the same folder as the script, to save the highscore
