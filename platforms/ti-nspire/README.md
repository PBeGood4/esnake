## Overview

The ti-nspire allows you to program in LUA, so that's the obvious choice, but using **ndless** (http://ndless.me/) you can also use python and javascript

So far, only the LUA version is done.

## Development

With the use of the Student Software, programming and seeing the immediate results was very easy.

There is also great documentation

Although this was my first time using LUA, it was pretty staightforward.

I have to complaint about the 1 based indexing (Drove me nuts) and the "then .. end" (Why not indents or brackets ðŸ˜¡)

## Remarks

This was the first ESnake program, so I try to base the others off this one

## Screenshots
