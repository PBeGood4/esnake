# ESnake - PSP (lua)

## Install

Paste this to your browser
```
https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/PBeGood4/esnake/tree/main/platforms/psp
```

You need a jailbroken psp to run this. Put **all** the files into /psp/game/*this folder*/

(Also works using the PPSSPP emulator)

## Overview

So yeah, I made this with LUA, and it is so slow it hurts. It starts with a playable framerate, but has you pick up more apples, the framerate starts dropping.

LUA is very slow, so I will try to make this again in the future, but using Rust.

## Development

Getting the LUA interpreter that worked in my psp was tedious, and Im not sure it will work on every psp, but I hope so.

I wanted to write this in Python, but I couldn't get the interpreter to work.

Really nothing else to say except, dont try making games to old systems using slow languages

## Remarks

The grid is just a .png because rendering every square was too slow ðŸ˜‚
