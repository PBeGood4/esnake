# ESnake - Scratch Edition

https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/530017698

## Development

So, the time has come to make Snake with my worst enemy, drag and drop programming.

It was ... weird. Not even tile based.

## Remarks

Instead of drawing each square of the grid, the grid is just a .png

The snake's tiles are not together, because I couldn't come up with a better way to do collision

The code is really simple, but it gets the job done
